  <p class="light flow-text" align="justify">
    The Markham Space Invaders are a high school robotics team located in Markham, Ontario comprised of students from
    across the region. We provide students with the opportunity to explore the fields of STEM (science, technology,
    engineering, and math) in a dynamic environment. We participate in the FIRST Robotics Competition yearly. The team
    was established with the objectives of promoting and raising awareness of STEM, a positive and stimulating
    environment for inventors,and providing a community forum to explore opportunities and apply skills in a
    competitive environment.
