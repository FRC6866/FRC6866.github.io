  <p class="light flow-text" align="center">
    The Markham Space Invaders are a high school robotics team located in Markham, Ontario, comprised of students from
    across the region. We provide students with the opportunity to explore robotics through the FIRST Robotics Program. The team
    was established with the objectives of promoting and raising awareness of STEM, creating a positive and stimulating
    environment for inventors, and providing a community forum to explore opportunities and apply skills in a
    competitive environment.
