## Issues

Find a issue with the webpages? Make a issue report (click that 'issues' tab).

## Contribution

We use Jekyll. That means posts should be created in a Markdown + HTML + Liquid format with YAML front matters. See [here](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a posting guide that is applicable to our website. Please refer to [this](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/) webpage to learn more about writing Jekyll compatible posts. You shouldn't have to touch anything other than the posts.

## Branches

Upon the suggestion of experienced web designers, we use 2 branches: develop, and master. Develop is used (as the name suggests) for the development of pages. Please send pull requests to that branch. We use master to host the website, so we will push develop to master periodically.
