Hello everyone,

We’re happy to announce our partnership with Markham Public Library to bring you our STEM Workshop at Markham Village Library! All attendees will have the chance to participate in workshops with fun Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math activities.

<!--more-->

Experiments are conducted with:

```
- household items (so, you can go home and conduct it again and again!) 
- technical equipment (such as Raspberry Pi, and Arduino)
- computing programs (such as Java, and C++)
- and most importantly...curiosity!
```

But this is not all! Not only we will be having interesting experiments and activities, but a junior and senior FIRST Lego League team will be also showcasing their own Lego competition robots, giving all attendees a chance to see what other children their age are doing with robotics. Our team will have a booth as well, presenting our robot and the continuous work we do throughout the year. Everyone will receive the opportunity to speak with team members about their first-hand experience in FIRST and robotics, possibly inspiring future high school students to join or start a team of their own. This fun experience, paired with inquisitive learners and growing knowledge will have everyone wanting to come back to learn more and more! Everyone whether you’re young or old, will have a thrilling opportunity of learning something new!

Meet us at Markham Village Library on December 29th from 10 AM - 1 PM. 

We hope to see you there!
