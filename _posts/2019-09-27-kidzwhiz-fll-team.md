One of our sponsors, Kidzwhiz, is hosting a FIRST LEGO League Robotics team this year!

Please complete this sign up form by Friday, September 20 if you're interested. Spots are limited!

The  FIRST® LEGO® League (FLL) is a program that supports children and youngsters in order to introduce them to science and technology in a sporty atmosphere.
 
The objective is to:
- make children and youngsters enthusiastic about science and technology
- to equip the participants with the idea of team spirit
- to encourage children and youngsters to solve complex tasks in a creative way
 
The basis of FLL is a robotics tournament in a cheerful atmosphere, where kids and youngsters need to solve a tricky “mission” with the help of a robot. The kids will research a given topic within a team, and plan, program, and test an autonomous robot to solve the mission.  

For more information on FLL, check out their website.

Please also feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

We look forward to having you join the team!
