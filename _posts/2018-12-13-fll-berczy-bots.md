Our journey began in the summer of 2018 when our team visited the school and gave a presentation about FIRST and a demonstration of our 2018 POWER UP robot. Many students expressed interest in starting a FLL team at Berczy. In October, the Berczy Bots officially started holding meetings. Several members from Team 6866 have been mentoring the team and overseeing the meetings.
