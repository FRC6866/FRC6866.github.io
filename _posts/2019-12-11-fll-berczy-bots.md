Starting October 2019, William Berczy students have attended after-school meetings twice per
week to prepare for the three components of FIRST Lego League: the Robot Game, the
Innovation Project, and the Core Values Activity. Dedicated students spent these meetings
designing, building, and programming their robot from scratch to complete objectives in this
year's FLL Game, City Shaper. Furthermore, students also participated in team-building
activities for their Core Values presentation. In addition, students prepared their Innovation
Projects by identifying problems with local infrastructure and buildings, coming up with solutions through research, and obtaining valuable profession opinions through email correspondence, phone calls, and video interviews.

Since William Berczy's robotics initiative was started in October of 2018 with the help of our
members, the program has grown from one team competing in FLL and YRDSB Skills
Challenge in the 2018-2019 school year to four teams competing in FLL and two teams
competing in Skills in the 2019-2020 school year. The program has provided over 50 students in
grades 5 to 8 with the opportunity to explore their interests in robotics, engineering, and science and to collaborate with peers who share their interests.
