            <p class="light">Team 6866 was founded in April 2017, by a group of students looking to build an accessible outlet for youth interested in exploring the STEM fields. We became a Not-for-Profit Corporation in August 2017. In November 2017, we increased to over 30 student members and 8 adult mentors. In January 2018, we headed into our first build season.</p>
