  <p class="light">Team 6866, Space Invaders is a high school robotics team located in Markham, Ontario comprised of students from across the region. The team provides students with the opportunity to explore the fields of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) in a dynamic environment. Our involvement in the program would not be possible without the gracious support of our dedicated mentors and generous sponsors.</p>
  <p class="light">The team was established with the objectives of: Promoting and raising awareness of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields, primarily in the York Region; Inspiring youth and others within the community to pursue careers in science, math, business, and the skilled trades; Establishing a positive and stimulating environment for inventors to develop, pursue, and refine product concepts; Providing a community forum to explore opportunities and apply business, engineering, math, skilled trades, and employability skills in a competitive environment; and Other such complementary purposes not inconsistent with these objects.</p>
  <p class="light">Team 6866 was founded in April 2017, by a group of students looking to build an accessible outlet for youth interested in exploring the STEM fields. We became a Not-for-Profit Corporation in August 2017. In November 2017, we increased to over 30 student members and 8 adult mentors. In January 2018, we headed into our first build season.</p>
